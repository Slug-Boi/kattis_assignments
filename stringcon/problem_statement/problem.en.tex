\problemname{Concatenating Kitties}
In the picturesque town of Purrington, a mischievous cat named Whiskers possessed an extraordinary talent for string concatenation. With a flick of his paw, Whiskers could seamlessly merge strings, creating a harmonious symphony of meows that enchanted the townsfolk.

Word of Whiskers' unique ability reached the renowned programmer, Professor Pawsington, who decided to celebrate the feline prodigy by organizing a coding competition. The challenge, known as "Concatenating Kitties," invited participants to write programs that could creatively concatenate Whiskers' meows. As the coding competition unfolded, the Concatenating Kitties challenge not only showcased the prowess of programmers but also brought a delightful fusion of whimsy and coding to the charming town of Purrington.
